## 🌀 Abstract

Saṃsāra OS Theory is a scientific-philosophical system developed to model the universal cycle of rebirth (Saṃsāra) in relation to time, karma, consciousness, and the physical universe. Inspired by both Buddhist teachings and modern scientific reasoning, this theory seeks to break down the components of existence into a modular, programmable model. 

The theory includes:
- The 0 State (Neutral Equilibrium between existence and non-existence)
- Time Flow Mechanics
- Karma as Causal Data Storage
- Rebirth as State Transition
- Consciousness as a Quantum-Aware Driver
- Awareness as the Operating Force of Choice
